    <h2>E Tender Application </h2>
    <p>
      A tender is an invitation to bid for a project. This bid could involve
      providing certain goods/products or services. There are four main types
      of tenders: open tender, closed tender, negotiated tender, and single-stage
      or two-stage tender. In most cases, government tenders are open tenders,
      i.e., any eligible supplier can bid and win the tender. This is done to
      encourage higher participation and ensure that the procurement team gets
      the best products/services at the most competitive prices.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most government and PSUs initiate bids for larger projects where eligible
      bidders respond within stipulated timelines. To respond to a bid, you need
      to submit a tender response to project your work in the best possible way.
