PG-DAC 2023 Project Repo

A tender is an invitation to bid for a project. This bid could involve providing certain goods/products or services. There are four main types of tenders: open tender, closed tender, negotiated tender, and single-stage or two-stage tender. In most cases, government tenders are open tenders, i.e., any eligible supplier can bid and win the tender. This is done to encourage higher participation and ensure that the procurement team gets the best products/services at the most competitive prices.

Most government and PSUs initiate bids for larger projects where eligible bidders respond within stipulated timelines. To respond to a bid, you need to submit a tender response to project your work in the best possible way.
